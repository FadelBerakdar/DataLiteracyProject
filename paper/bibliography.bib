GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.}",

abstract = {Reanalysis products have become more and more popular for wind energy scientific community to analyze the wind speed variability and get long-term wind power estimations. The present study evaluates the biases of near-surface wind speed and wind power density in four of the most reputable reanalysis datasets, which include ERA-Interim, JRA-55, CFS and MERRA-2. The results indicate that the abilities of reanalysis products to reproduce the variabilities of wind speeds are different in different regions. JRA-55 and CFS offer the best estimates of annual and seasonal variabilities of surface wind speeds over the Northern Hemisphere. In detail, JRA-55 is the best to reproduce surface wind speeds in Asia, CFS has the best performance in Europe, and MERRA-2 just can reproduce the central part of North America. All the four datasets show decreasing tendencies in surface winds over the Northern Hemisphere during 1980–2016, although the trends are largely diverse among them. The most significant disagreements of wind speed trends are encountered between JRA-55 and MERRA-2, which are likely related to the different methodologies from the lowest model level that reanalyses use. The main drivers of wind speed trends are the changes of large-scale circulation, urbanization, and aerosol emissions.}
